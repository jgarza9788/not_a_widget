# Not_A_Widget
this is not a widget.
This is a Python Script that creates an Image of Text that one would use with the [Background Logo Extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7364/background-logo/), in order to create a psudo-widget of sorts for the gnome desktop environment.

## what about conky?
well i was hoping for something that uses python, or maybe javascript, html, and css.
but conky is better for effiency.

## how it works
run every x via cron or something.
and the Background Logo Extension should update automatically.
